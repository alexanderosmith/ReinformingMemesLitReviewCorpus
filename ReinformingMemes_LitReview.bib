  abstract = {In the second edition of The Selfish Gene, Richard Dawkins included a short bibliometric analysis of key papers instrumental to the sociobiological revolution, the intention of which was to support his proposal that ideas spread within a population in an epidemiological manner. In his analysis, Dawkins primarily discussed the influence of an article by British evolutionary biologist William Donald Hamilton which had introduced the concept of "inclusive fitness", and he argued that citations to it were accumulating in a very different manner to two other seminal papers, demonstrating the appearance and spread of a new "meme" in academic circles. This paper re-examines Dawkins' original analysis and the conclusions drawn from it, and updates those conclusions based on citation data accumulated in the intervening three decades since publication. This updated analysis shows that patterns of citation for the three papers, and Dawkins' book itself, are actually remarkably similar and show no qualitative difference in citation growth. The data are well described by a two-phase exponential model of citation growth in which citations accumulate rapidly and then saturate at a slower level of growth dictated primarily by the general increase in scientific production. It is speculated that this two-phase exponential growth, with some modification to account for papers that are not immediately discovered, may be a signature that will help to reveal the emergence of genuinely novel ideas within the academic literature. © 2017 by the author.},

  abstract = {This article investigates the dominant messages Internet memes communicate about religion. Internet memes about religion are defined as, ‘memes circulated on the Internet whose images and texts focus on a variety of religious themes and/or religious traditions’ (Bellar et~al., 2013). By drawing on meme genres identified by Shifman (2012) and analyzing techniques used to frame ideas concerning religion in memes, this study identifies common genres found amongst religious Internet meme and core frames used to present messages and assumptions about religion online. This article further draws attention to the importance of studying religion in digital contexts, as it highlights trends, recognized by scholars toward ‘Lived Religion’ within digital culture (Campbell, 2012). Lived Religion argues that contemporary media and digital culture provide important resources for presenting popular beliefs about religion. This study also suggests that studying Internet memes about religion provides a useful lens for understanding popular conceptions about religion within mainstream culture. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

  abstract = {It is commonly agreed upon that misperception is detrimental. However, misperception might have a beneficial effect from a collective viewpoint when individuals mis-percept incoming information that promotes a specific kind of behavior, which leads to an increase in diversity. First, this paper proposes our hypothesis regarding adaptive property of misperception based on the argument of the relationship between misperception and behavioral diversity, and the effects of communication on diversity. Then, a simple computational model is constructed for a resource-searching problem by using the multi-agent modeling method. We investigate both direct misperception, that are caused when obtaining information directly from surrounding environment, and indirect misperception, that are caused when obtaining information indirectly through communication by conducting simulation experiments. The experimental results have shown that misperception could increase diversity in behavior of agents, thus could be adaptive, while accurate communication could decrease a diversity of agent behavior, which might decrease fitness. This paper also discusses a correlative relationship between direct misperception and indirect misperception. We believe that the study on adaptive property of misperception based on an innovative frame of reference and a powerful methodology in the field of complex system or artificial life would shed light on fundamental issues in cognitive science, memetics and engineering.},

  abstract = {When viewing an archived page using the archive’s user interface (UI), the user selects a datetime to view from a list. The archived web page, if available, is then displayed. From this display, the web archive UI attempts to simulate the web browsing experience by smoothly transitioning between archived pages. During this process, the target datetime changes with each link followed, potentially drifting away from the datetime originally selected. For sparsely archived resources, this almost transparent drift can be many years in just a few clicks. We conducted 200,000 acyclic walks of archived pages, following up to 50 links per walk, comparing the results of two target datetime policies. The Sliding Target policy allows the target datetime to change as it does in archive UIs such as the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. The Sticky Target policy, represented by the Memento API, keeps the target datetime the same throughout the walk. We found that the Sliding Target policy drift increases with the number of walk steps, number of domains visited, and choice (number of links available). However, the Sticky Target policy controls temporal drift, holding it to \$\${$<\$\$<$}30~days on average regardless of walk length or number of domains visited. The Sticky Target policy shows some increase as choice increases, but this may be caused by other factors. We conclude that based on walk length, the Sticky Target policy generally produces at least 30~days less drift than the Sliding Target policy. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract = {Since the late 1970s, the Mexican government has been embroiled in an armed conflict with the drug cartels, and criminal organisations have engaged in violent confrontations with each other. Violence escalated in 2006 under the presidency of Felipe Calderón Hinojosa, and since then killings have become spectacular and highly mediatised. An often-overlooked front of the cartel wars is the use of non-official networked media that generates and sustains popular narratives about cartel leaders. In this paper, we focus on the media assemblages that sustain the myths associated with the now captured ‘El Chapo’ Guzmán, perhaps the most celebrated narco in Mexican history. In particular, we focus on the phenomenon of the El Chapo memes as these have moved into a new phase via digital platforms such as Whatapps. We argue the El Chapo memes play an important role in popular communication revolving around narco culture, functioning as artefacts of and even opportunities for political contestation, as well as everyday humour and survival. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

This is especially true in post soviet Central and Eastern European countries (Khroul 2013, Kołodziejska 2014, Rončáková 2017, Tudor \& Bratosin, 2018). This article provides a summary of the international and Hungarian-related research history of the area, highlighting the turning points that originate from the change of the media technology, the media history or followed the rearrangement of general media research. For the first point, mentioning the initial radio, cinema, and television research, and then the current examination of the Internet. For the second point, the acceptance media studies replacing the early media effect researches, the so-called cultural or interpretative turn in media studies and the uses and gratifications approach starting in the 1970s are classified. Following this, the aim of the article is to present and compare the different religious media research typologies and finally, the descriptive presentation of contemporary research directions in international and Hungarian science. The study mentions not only theoretical, but research methodological possibilities as well.},

  abstract = {This paper seeks to build upon the previous literature on gender aspects in research collaboration and knowledge diffusion. Our approach adds the meme inheritance notion to traditional citation analysis, as we investigate if scientific memes are inherited differently from gendered authorship. Since authors of scientific papers inherit knowledge from their cited authors, once authorship is gendered we are able to characterize the inheritance process with respect to the frequencies of memes and their propagation scores depending on the gender of the authors. By applying methods that enable the gender disambiguation of authors, missing data on the gender of citing and cited authors is dealt with. Our empirically based approach allows for investigating the combined effect of meme inheritance and gendered transmission. Results show that scientific memes do not spread differently from either male or female cited authors. Likewise, the memes that we analyse were not found to propagate more easily via male or female inheritance. © 2018, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

  abstract = {This paper traces the recent turn to humour, irony and ambiguity embodied in the adaptation of memes into the repertoire of online propaganda of the militant neo-Nazi group the Nordic Resistance Movement; in a process, we dub the ‘memefication’ of white supremacism. Drawing on a combination of quantitative visual content analysis (VCA) and in-depth visual analysis focused on iconography and symbolism, we explore all memes (N = 634) created and circulated by the group around the 2018 general elections in the country. The analysis proceeds in two steps: First, we present the results of the VCA in which we identified five thematic categories of memes crafting white supremacy, xenophobia, homophobia, misogyny and anti-Semitic ideas onto esoteric and popular culture iconography then to map these across a matrix of content and form. We then proceed to the analysis of the cluster of memes coded as violent to explore the iconography and symbolism used to promote violence and death threats and render them banal. We draw on a range of recent scholarship on the entanglement of memes in the rise of the far-right and engage critical perspectives on the necropower of fascism to explore the interplay between ambiguous, playful and jokey imagery on the one hand and the murder fantasies and serious threat of white supremacist violence at the heart of neo-Nazi ideology, on the other. © 2021 The Author(s).

  abstract = {In this paper, we investigate memes about student issues. We consider the memes as expressions of a new networked student public that contain discourses that may fall outside the mainstream discourse on higher education. The paper is based on content analysis of 179 posts in the public Facebook Group ‘Student Problem Memes’, combined with a nine-month media watch and a discussion workshop with 15 students. Through self-deprecating humour, students create an inverse attention economy of competitive one-downmanship, where the goal is to display humorous failure instead of perfect appearance. Our analysis shows that students use humour to express, share, and commiserate over daily struggles, but also that the problems related to work/study balance and mental health, are experienced as a persistent feature of student living. We also analyse limitations of meme-based publics, emphasizing processes of inclusion and exclusion through specific vernaculars of visual and discursive humour where issues related to gender, race, orientation, class, and ability are sidelined in favour of relatable humour. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

  abstract = {Internet memes are a pervasive phenomenon on the social Web. They typically consist of viral catch phrases, images, or videos that spread through instant messaging, (micro) blogs, forums, and social networking sites. Due to their popularity and proliferation, Internet memes attract interest in areas as diverse as marketing, sociology, or computer science and have been dubbed a new form of communication or artistic expression. In this paper, we examine the merits of such claims and analyze how collective attention into Internet memes evolves over time. We introduce and discuss statistical models of the dynamics of fads and fit them to meme related time series obtained from Google Trends. Given data as to more than 200 memes, we find that our models provide more accurate descriptions of the dynamics of growth and decline of collective attention to individual Internet memes than previous approaches from the literature. In short, our results suggest that Internet memes are nothing but fads.},

The libraries cover a large, sparsely inhabited area: the librarians have chosen to see this not as a handicap but rather as an opportunity to constantly adapt services to local needs. The network's flexibility, suited to a system geared towards local needs, as such small structures must be, is a potent political choice, making reading promotion a tool for social and cultural outreach which goes beyond the basic remit of promoting books and reading to explore the specific role of libraries in the cultural policies of small, rural local authorities.},

These findings argue that memes provide an important sphere for investigating and understanding religious meaning-making online, which expresses key attributes of participatory culture and trends towards lived religion.},

  abstract = {Innovation studies has largely focused on technological assets, while leaving other sources and forms of innovation less tackled. Among this neglected corpus, this article stresses the important role played by symbolic value in the consumption and production processes of innovative goods and services. I explore especially Internet-memes that represent iconic productions of the Internet ‘lead culture’ which embed significant symbolic values. This article therefore, refers to the economic sociology and innovation management literature to emphasise the force of these creations of symbolic value by culture-lead communities, through their production of Internet-memes. I argue that Internet-memes represent a widespread source of innovation in various sectors (from cultural industries to less expect ones like finance). While exploratory, the present study extends the debate on the nature of innovation, its symbolic and cultural aspects and its diffusion processes. It ultimately suggests potential new paths for innovation policies to tackle these new forms of innovations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

Citizens’ reactivity is increasingly important in contemporary political communication. The politicians’ posts can reach the wider public through the citizens’ public reactions. While we have extended knowledge about mass media reactivity, citizens’ political reactivity on social media is highly underexplored. This study is intended to fill this gap by examining what type of political content can trigger reaction from followers on politicians’ Facebook pages. The data contain 7048 Facebook posts by 183 single-member district candidates posted during the Hungarian general election campaign in 2014. The unit of analysis is the individual Facebook post, and the dependent variables are the numbers of likes, comments, and shares. The independent variables are the structural (text, picture, video, etc.) and substantial (content, emotional tone, etc.) characteristics of each post, after controlling for, inter alia, a general follower-activity score on politicians’ Facebook pages. Results showed that citizens are highly reactive to negative emotion-filled, text-using, personal, and activity-demanding posts. Virality is especially facilitated by memes, videos, negative contents and mobilizing posts, and posts containing a call for sharing. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

  abstract = {The history of laboratories may become controversial in social sciences. In this paper, the story of Sciences Po Médialab told by Venturini et~al. is discussed and completed by demonstrating the incoherence in the choice of digital methods at the Médialab from the actor network theory perspective. As the Médialab mostly used web topologies as structural analysis of social positions, they were not able to account for the propagation of ideas, considered in actor network theory as non-humans that have their own agency. The main arguments in favour of the ‘more continuous social’ developed at the Médialab (quali-quanti, following the actors, zooming) proved to be as misleading as the network metaphor. The distribution of agency that actor network theory so successfully expands was paradoxicallty reduced to structures and individual preferences, to the detriment of the agency of replications that circulate entities in the form of messages, content or memes, and that should now become the next step for actor network theory-style digital methods. © The Author(s) 2018.},

  abstract = {As web technologies evolve, web archivists work to adapt so that digital history is preserved. Recent advances in web technologies have introduced client-side executed scripts (Ajax) that, for example, load data without a change in top level Universal Resource Identifier (URI) or require user interaction (e.g., content loading via Ajax when the page has scrolled). These advances have made automating methods for capturing web pages more difficult. In an effort to understand why mementos (archived versions of live resources) in today’s archives vary in completeness and sometimes pull content from the live web, we present a study of web resources and archival tools. We used a collection of URIs shared over Twitter and a collection of URIs curated by Archive-It in our investigation. We created local archived versions of the URIs from the Twitter and Archive-It sets using WebCite, wget, and the Heritrix crawler. We found that only 4.2 \% of the Twitter collection is perfectly archived by all of these tools, while 34.2 \% of the Archive-It collection is perfectly archived. After studying the quality of these mementos, we identified the practice of loading resources via JavaScript (Ajax) as the source of archival difficulty. Further, we show that resources are increasing their use of JavaScript to load embedded resources. By 2012, over half (54.5 \%) of pages use JavaScript to load embedded resources. The number of embedded resources loaded via JavaScript has increased by 12.0 \% from 2005 to 2012. We also show that JavaScript is responsible for 33.2 \% more missing resources in 2012 than in 2005. This shows that JavaScript is responsible for an increasing proportion of the embedded resources unsuccessfully loaded by mementos. JavaScript is also responsible for 52.7 \% of all missing embedded resources in our study. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract = {Web archives do not always capture every resource on every page that they attempt to archive. This results in archived pages missing a portion of their embedded resources. These embedded resources have varying historic, utility, and importance values. The proportion of missing embedded resources does not provide an accurate measure of their impact on the Web page; some embedded resources are more important to the utility of a page than others. We propose a method to measure the relative value of embedded resources and assign a damage rating to archived pages as a way to evaluate archival success. In this paper, we show that Web users’ perceptions of damage are not accurately estimated by the proportion of missing embedded resources. In fact, the proportion of missing embedded resources is a less accurate estimate of resource damage than a random selection. We propose a damage rating algorithm that provides closer alignment to Web user perception, providing an overall improved agreement with users on memento damage by 17~\% and an improvement by 51~\% if the mementos have a damage rating delta \$\${$>\$\$>$}0.30. We use our algorithm to measure damage in the Internet Archive, showing that it is getting better at mitigating damage over time (going from a damage rating of 0.16 in 1998 to 0.13 in 2013). However, we show that a greater number of important embedded resources (2.05 per memento on average) are missing over time. Alternatively, the damage in WebCite is increasing over time (going from 0.375 in 2007 to 0.475 in 2014), while the missing embedded resources remain constant (13~\% of the resources are missing on average). Finally, we investigate the impact of JavaScript on the damage of the archives, showing that a crawler that can archive JavaScript-dependent representations will reduce memento damage by 13.5~\%. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract = {The term “internet trolling” has come to encompass a wide range of behaviours, ranging from abusive speech and hacking to sarcastic humour and friendly teasing. While some of these behaviours are clearly antisocial and, in extreme cases, criminal, others are harmless and may even have potential prosocial functions. This study is an attempt to disambiguate some of the competing and contrary interpretations of internet trolling by examining the perspectives of avid internet users for whom trolling is a familiar part of their online lives. Through data collected from in-depth, semi-structured interviews, a multifaceted picture of trolling emerges that is at odds with previous media characterizations of internet trolls as merely hateful bullies. On the contrary, most participants in this study did not consider trolling to be a serious problem and many did not consider harmful interactions to be trolling at all. This paper describes some of the defining characteristics of internet trolling in order to differentiate the harmful behaviours from the harmless. This work aims to contribute to the growing body of literature on internet trolling in the hopes of informing regulatory policy and educational initiatives concerning internet use and safety.

  abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to document the development path of a specific concept during its first 20 years. Design/methodology/approach – Evidence was extracted of the citation-counts of relevant articles, uses of the term in other articles that do not cite the original articles, and uses of terms with similar meanings. Examination of the data took into account insights from epidemiology, memetics and diffusion of innovations theory. Findings – The concept has had insufficient impact to overcome the weaknesses in theory and practice that it was intended to address. It has lacked champions. It has proven to be sufficiently fit to survive, but not to flourish. Research limitations/implications – Google Scholar has a wide catchment area, and hence provides a basis for tracking the path of development of new ideas. However, the tools remain fairly blunt, and do not, for example, enable efficient extraction of patterns of citation over time, or the nature of the uses made of terms by the citing articles. Practical implications – Neologisms take on a life of their own, losing the associations that they were intended to have with other ideas, and shedding their embedment in a body of theory. For a new term to successfully project a meme, its proponent must enthuse a critical mass of early adopters to apply it, and to generate a further round of adopters. Originality/value – Concepts are seldom tracked over time. This paper shows that a new term and its associated body of theory require more than publications in top-level journals if they are to have significant impacts on academic research and industry practice. © 2014, © Authors.},

  abstract = {With the rise of web 2.0 and social media platforms taking over vast tracts of territory on the internet, the media landscape has shifted drastically in the past 20 years, transforming previously stable relationships between media creators and consumers. The Social Media Reader is the first collection to address the collective transformation with pieces on social media, peer production, copyright politics, and other aspects of contemporary internet culture from all the major thinkers in the field. Culling a broad range and incorporating different styles of scholarship from foundational pieces and published articles to unpublished pieces, journalistic accounts, personal narratives from blogs, and whitepapers, The Social Media Reader promises to be an essential text, with contributions from Lawrence Lessig, Henry Jenkins, Clay Shirky, Tim O'Reilly, Chris Anderson, Yochai Benkler, danah boyd, and Fred von Loehmann, to name a few. It covers a wide-ranging topical terrain, much like the internet itself, with particular emphasis on collaboration and sharing, the politics of social media and social networking, Free Culture and copyright politics, and labour and ownership. Theorizing new models of collaboration, identity, commerce, copyright, ownership, and labour, these essays outline possibilities for cultural democracy that arise when the formerly passive audience becomes active cultural creators, while warning of the dystopian potential of new forms of surveillance and control.},

As journalists and researchers in communication, we are concerned about newspapers' sustainability, and we refuse to consider a future scenario without the press. According to this objective we focus on the entertainment industry with the goal of learning from it how to survive and even grow despite freely available content on the Web. We consider the unstoppable growth in users and revenue experienced by Netflix, Amazon and iTunes, and pull from it lessons learned that might help newspapers to navigate the digital landscape. Our hypothesis is that digital newspapers can find new readers in the segment of digital consumers who already "pay" for digital content including streaming movies and television shows. Sales, subscriptions, and online rentals experienced significant growth in 2013, bringing them closer to the sales figures of hardware such as DVDs and blu-ray discs. And, although piracy is an issue in the entertainment industry, there remains room for revenue growth. © 2015, El Profesional de la Informacion. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {This article reports the findings from simulating the spatial diffusion processes of memes over social media networks by using the approach of agent-based modeling. Different from other studies, this article examines how space and distance affect the diffusion of memes. Simulations were carried out to emulate and to allow assessment of the different levels of efficiency that memes spread spatially and temporally. Analyzed network structures include random networks and preferential attachment networks. Simulated spatial processes for meme diffusion include independent cascade models and linear threshold models. Both simulated and real-world social networks were used in the analysis. Findings indicate that the numbers of information sources and opinion leaders affect the processes of meme diffusion. In addition, geography is still important in the processes of spatial diffusion of memes over social media networks. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

  abstract = {The work of the battle artist I. A. Vladimirov falls under the category of narrative art, a genre with a long history going back to cave paintings. Although painting with a subtext is fairly universal, many art historians have discerned a specifically Russian affinity for story-telling art. Victoria Bonnell sees the template for modern Russian poster art in ancient icons (The Iconography of Art, University of California, 1997), and Valerie Kivelson sees the preeminence of image over text in the sixteenth-century manuscript Litsevoi letopisnyi svod (“Expressive Gestures,” Canadian-American Slavic Studies 52, 2018). In modern fine art circles, however, narrative imagery has typically been relegated to second-rate status, as mere illustrations or even kitsch. The unexpectedly expressive empathy in the paintings by I. A. Vladimirov forces viewers to reevaluate this condescension. He developed his own language of attributes, tropes, and memes that can be decoded with attention to the many small details in his quickly drawn lines. With careful viewing, his artwork conveys the everyday reality of revolutionary Russia with both pity and humor, and with a skill that should not be underestimated. © Elena S. Danielson.},

  abstract = {With the rise of web 2.0 and social media platforms taking over vast tracts of territory on the internet, the media landscape has shifted drastically in the past 20 years, transforming previously stable relationships between media creators and consumers. The Social Media Reader is the first collection to address the collective transformation with pieces on social media, peer production, copyright politics, and other aspects of contemporary internet culture from all the major thinkers in the field. Culling a broad range and incorporating different styles of scholarship from foundational pieces and published articles to unpublished pieces, journalistic accounts, personal narratives from blogs, and whitepapers, The Social Media Reader promises to be an essential text, with contributions from Lawrence Lessig, Henry Jenkins, Clay Shirky, Tim O'Reilly, Chris Anderson, Yochai Benkler, danah boyd, and Fred von Loehmann, to name a few. It covers a wide-ranging topical terrain, much like the internet itself, with particular emphasis on collaboration and sharing, the politics of social media and social networking, Free Culture and copyright politics, and labour and ownership. Theorizing new models of collaboration, identity, commerce, copyright, ownership, and labour, these essays outline possibilities for cultural democracy that arise when the formerly passive audience becomes active cultural creators, while warning of the dystopian potential of new forms of surveillance and control.},

  abstract = {Over the past fifteen years, our perspective on tackling information interoperability problems for web-based scholarship has evolved significantly. In this opinion piece, we look back at three efforts that we have been involved in that aptly illustrate this evolution: OAI-PMH, OAI-ORE, and Memento. Understanding that no interoperability specification is neutral, we attempt to characterize the perspectives and technical toolkits that provided the basis for these endeavors. With that regard, we consider repository-centric and web-centric interoperability perspectives, and the use of a Linked Data or a REST/HATEAOS technology stack, respectively. We also lament the lack of interoperability across nodes that play a role in web-based scholarship, but end on a constructive note with some ideas regarding a possible path forward. © 2015 Herbert Van de Sompel and Michael L. Nelson.},

  note = {This paper is the first paper to attempt to remodel Leskovek et al.'s model of evolutionary memetics in a visual framework rather than from a textual framework on blogs. This paper does several really interesting things. Firstly, it frames itself as diffusion and evolution of digital images. Secondly, it reports both textual analysis and visual analysis methodologies: image features were gathered using convolutional neural networks and text features were gathered using optical character recognition. Further, this paper reports the algorithms it used in order to do these things. It used median blending in order to make a stable image template to compare other images to.
\par
This paper will be useful in comparing to on diffusion and evolutionary models of memetics.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the topic of social media users’ polyvocal political activism facilitated by participatory culture and expressed through multimodal digital humour (including humorous memes) in the context of a threat of a regime. The focus of attention is political humour on the r/HongKong subreddit, specifically the posts pertinent to the ongoing boycott movement of multiple companies consequent upon their actions in response to the 2019 protests in Hong Kong. Apart from presenting the multimodal characteristics of the creative digital data through the lens of Multimodal Critical Discourse Analysis, the central aim is to discuss the functions of users’ political humour online, offering various socio-pragmatic conclusions about the polyvocal participatory practice at hand. It is argued that this digital humour resides solely in the attention-grabbing form, with the otherwise serious posts performing informative and persuasive functions as they convey community members’ socio-political critique. While disparaging the ‘butts’, online users do bonding through collectively expressing their political dissent (which also gives them psychological relief) and sharing subversive ideologies. The humorous items inform and warn potential punters and tacitly call for a boycott of the companies that bow to the regime, all in an act of solidarity with Hong Kong protesters. © 2020 The Author(s).

While disparaging the ‘butts’, online users do bonding through collectively expressing their political dissent (which also gives them psychological relief) and sharing subversive ideologies. The humorous items inform and warn potential punters and tacitly call for a boycott of the companies that bow to the regime, all in an act of solidarity with Hong Kong protesters. © 2020 The Author(s).

  abstract = {Advancing the concept of multimodal voicing as a tool for describing user-generated online humour, this paper reports a study on humorous COVID-19 mask memes. The corpus is drawn from four popular social media platforms and examined through a multimodal discourse analytic lens. The dominant memetic trends are elucidated and shown to rely programmatically on nested (multimodal) voices, whether compatible or divergent, as is the case with the dissociative echoing of individuals wearing peculiar masks or the dissociative parodic echoing of their collective voice. The theoretical thrust of this analysis is that, as some memes are (re)posted across social media (sometimes going viral), the previous voice(s) – of the meme subject/author/poster – can be re-purposed (e.g. ridiculed) or unwittingly distorted. Overall, this investigation offers new theoretical and methodological implications for the study of memes: it indicates the usefulness of the notions of multimodal voicing, intertextuality and echoing as research apparatus; and it brings to light the epistemological ambiguity in lay and academic understandings of memes, the voices behind which cannot always be categorically known. © The Author(s) 2020.},

  abstract = {This paper reports the findings of a study of two automatically generated corpora of multimodal digital items user-tagged as ‘Black Lives Matter memes’ and ‘Blue Lives Matter memes’. The central aim is to flesh out the memetic trends representing the discourses and ideologies on the Black and blue memescape, which is explored in the wake of the most infamous but interest-generating tragedy in the history of the Blue Lives Matter movement, namely George Floyd's death at the hands of white police officer Derek Chauvin. Studied through a Multimodal Critical Discourse Analytic lens, the internet memes are shown to contribute to the polyvocal political discussion and, with some neutral or ambiguous exceptions, to display a positive (pro-) or–more often–negative (anti-) stance on each of the opposite movements (with anti-BLM items consituting the largest category in the dataset). Also, contrary to the well-entrenched conceptualisation of memes as a type of humour, the majority of the memes at hand manifest no humorous potential. Humour is present mainly among the negative-stance memes, which points to the disparagement of a target as a concomitant of humour in the memes on this serious political topic. © 2021 The Author(s).

  abstract = {On 26 February 2014, the US government’s Department of Health and Human Services posted a new public information campaign message to their Facebook page and Twitter feed. Intended to encourage people to sign up for health insurance, it showed a photo of a Japanese Shiba Inu dog romping in the snow, surrounded by text fragments in a brightly coloured Comic Sans font: So health insurance. Very benefits. Wow. Many coverage. Much affordable. Such HealthCare.gov. This particular breed of dog, this particular font and colour scheme, and this particular grammar – very noun, much adjective, wow – are the elements of the doge internet meme, in which pictures of an identified individual dog are remixed into a more and more elaborate repertoire of references to be shared across social media networks. The use of what was at the time a relatively new internet meme in a government health campaign illustrates how quickly and how widely such practices now circulate. In this case, what began as an in-joke for users of 4Chan, Tumblr and Reddit spread to political campaigning, commercial advertising and a functioning doge-based currency in a matter of months. This chapter examines such internet memes as forms of text and practice that arenative to the social media environment, illustrating that environment’s fundamental aesthetic and production logics of remix. Social media are networked platforms that combine public with personal communication. They grow by having their users contribute content, thus building the database that those platforms can exploit for advertising and marketing. Social media are those that allow any user, in principle, to say and make things; to share the things that they or others have said and made; and to make that saying, making and sharing visible to others in contexts where it is often far from clear who is watching or why. The personal relationships and experiences of the individual user take on a public quality, while more familiar forms of media content become the focus of personal communication that is visible to others. So social media can be understood by analysing their uses and affordances in terms of creativity, sharing and visibility.},

  abstract = {A cultural phenomenon called ‘mo ha’ (toad worship) has been increasingly popular on the Chinese Internet since 2014, with ‘the toad’ referring to former Party and country leader Jiang Zemin. His memes have gone viral. To examine the toad worship fever, I propose a two-dimensional framework: on the one hand, it differentiates the political and apolitical aspects of the content, and on the other hand, it draws from James Carey’s two views of communication to examine the functions. I collected and analyzed more than 100 toad worship memes, interviewed 24 creators and sharers of the memes, and conducted participant observation in two toad worship online communities. The framework yields four aspects of the phenomenon: implicit criticism toward the current leadership and the regime, ritual satire among groups of dissidents, playfulness, and a shared community with cultural capital and rituals. The motivations of participants are not only multi-faceted, but also fluid. This study contributes to the study of Internet memes and online expression in authoritarian regimes. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

  abstract = {The 2012 US Presidential debates were hybrid media events. Millions of viewers ‘dual-screened’ them, simultaneously watching their televisions and commenting on their social media feeds. In doing so, they helped transform verbal gaffes and zingers into debate-defining moments that may have influenced public opinion and media coverage. To examine this phenomenon, we apply network and qualitative textual analyses to a unique data set of over 1.9 million tweets from the first and third presidential debates. We address two questions of networked information flow within the debate-relevant Twittersphere: who was most responsible for spreading the ‘Big Bird’ and ‘horses and bayonets’ memes, and how did they use humour to discuss it? Our results reveal that non-traditional political actors were prominent network hubs in both debates and that humour was widespread in the first debate and among anti-Romney users. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor \& Francis.},

  abstract = {The 2012 US Presidential debates were hybrid media events. Millions of viewers ‘dual-screened’ them, simultaneously watching their televisions and commenting on their social media feeds. In doing so, they helped transform verbal gaffes and zingers into debate-defining moments that may have influenced public opinion and media coverage. To examine this phenomenon, we apply network and qualitative textual analyses to a unique data set of over 1.9 million tweets from the first and third presidential debates. We address two questions of networked information flow within the debate-relevant Twittersphere: who was most responsible for spreading the ‘Big Bird’ and ‘horses and bayonets’ memes, and how did they use humour to discuss it? Our results reveal that non-traditional political actors were prominent network hubs in both debates and that humour was widespread in the first debate and among anti-Romney users. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor \& Francis.},

  abstract = {Protest avatars, digital images that act as collective symbols for protest movements, have been widely used by supporters of the 2011 protest wave, from Egypt to Spain and the United States. From photos of Egyptian martyr Khaled Said, to protest posters and multiple variations of Anonymous' mask, a great variety of images have been adopted as profile pictures by Internet users to express their support for various causes and protest movements and communicate it to all their Internet peers. In this article, I explore protest avatars as forms of identification of protest movements in a digital era. I argue that protest avatars can be described as ‘memetic signifiers’ because (a) they are marked by a vagueness and inclusivity that distinguishes them from traditional protest symbols and (b) lend themselves to be used as memes for viral diffusion on social networks. In adopting these icons, participants experience a collective fusion in an online crowd, whose gathering is manifested in the very ‘masking’ of participants behind protest avatars. These forms of collective identification, while powerful in the short term, can however prove quite volatile, with Internet users often discarding avatars with relative ease, raising the question whether they can provide durable foundational elements of contemporary social movements. © 2015 Taylor \& Francis.},

This fonds covers the whole life of the musician, and includes among others the manuscripts of a number of works unknown elsewhere, several of which remain unpublished. The article describes the main features of the fonds and provides detailed lists of contents for the manuscripts as part of a case study explaining the new rules applied since 2013 by the Music department of the Bibliotheque nationale de France for the description of its archival fonds, involving both the \&quot;BnF Archives et manuscrits\&quot; (BAM) catalogue with finding aids in EAD and the general catalogue with bibliographic records in InterMarc format.},

  note = {This paper offers 3 case studies considering humor theory around "satire" in order to frame what happens with information flows surrounding alt-right rhetoric and memetic communication.
\par
The argument given is that while certainly satire or half-support in the form of memetic play is usual and common, eventually through distances of networks (perhaps social or informational distances, it is unclear) eventually these bits of information find their way to places which agree with them if they propagate long enough. Naturally this is a serious ethical concern considering its influence towards marginalized communities.
\par
It would be interesting to see how this kind or rhetoric functions for the left and see if it is unique in its propagation. However, my instinct and prior reading suggests it is not different. Additionally, and more broadly, ti would be interesting to see if there are ways of tracing these kinds of "intentional" humor across networks and see if ultimately new contexts create humor loss.

Ultimately, I see this as a paper that contributes to how academics should question the propagation of various kinds of intended seriocomic humor across networks, and how that distribution of information changes. This is a serious interest to contagion studies.},

  abstract = {The meaning of the concept of natural selection undergoes important changes when it circulates, through the use of analogies, between the realms of biological and cultural phenomena. These changes are not easily detected, but they are unavoidable. They have to do with differences between the properties of cultural phenomena and those of biological phenomena: in particular, the absence of the equivalent of a Hardy-Weinberg law for culture. These differences make it necessary to translate the concepts of classic population genetics into the language of transmission. This translation enables the theorists discussed here to build a unitary general theory of evolution (GTE) based on analogies between biological and cultural evolution, and at the same time to single out their differences. But the unity and the rigor of this theoretical approach are merely apparent. The concept of selection as it is defined here loses, in its three spheres of application - GTE, culture but also biology - the meaning and explanatory power it has in classic population genetics. This means that the mechanism of Darwinian selection cannot be considered as a universal algorithm that is valid for both biological and cultural phenomena alike. © The Author(s) 2012.},

  abstract = {Autoethnography offers a promising methodology to illuminate information experiences, yet it has been relegated to the margins of information science. This paper reviews examples and critiques of autoethnographic research and supports the idea that autoethnographic approaches increase information professionals' awareness of their cultural assumptions and provide a framework for analysing such assumptions when developing programs and services (Michels 2010, 166). By showcasing an exemplary autoethnographic study (Michels 2010), this paper presents autoethnography as a useful methodology that acknowledges the researcher's subjectivity, accounts for the affective aspects of information experiences, and focuses on how personal stories can teach us about information behaviour. © 2013 The Canadian Journal of Information and Library Science.},

  abstract = {In this era of participatory and social media, memes have become a user-generated form of political discussion. The online conversation surrounding Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis who was jailed for refusing to issue gay marriage licenses provides insight into the rhetoric used in political memes. Through qualitative and quantitative analysis using a lens of feminist humor theory, this study of Davis-related memes suggests that users trying to battle anti-gay ideologies resorted to anti-feminist rhetoric by targeting her physical appearance as a woman and using traditional ‘slut humor.’ Additionally, civil rights comparisons illustrate a misconstrued understanding of race and hegemony. Thus, far from serving as an alternative public sphere for marginalized voices, we conclude Internet memes are maintaining the status quo, furthering gendered political and communications systems and virtually ignoring the underlying gay rights issue. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

Here, we try to analyze the true meaning of Tamil memes by categorizing them as troll and non-troll. We propose an ingenious model comprising of a transformer-transformer architecture that tries to attain state-of-the-art by using attention as its main component. The dataset consists of troll and non-troll images with their captions as text. The task is a binary classification task. The objective of the model is to pay more attention to the extracted features and to ignore the noise in both images and text.},

  abstract = {Understanding social movement structures is important for political decision-makers to enable them to recognise the various motivating factors behind these movements. The Fridays for Future movement characterises a political group that has a majority of young people, frequently using social media to organise actions. By conducting a social network analysis on hashtags, this study contributes to the understanding of the global Fridays for Future movement. Particularly, we focus on the use and connection of hashtags on Instagram. We collected 59,112 posts tagged with \#fridaysforfuture and analysed 91,172 hashtags used therein. Subsequently, the 140 most used hashtags were divided into 11 clusters, which provide not only information about the organisation of the social movement via social media, but also insights into lifestyle-related aspects. The clusters include the topics: climate; nutrition, lifestyle and health; memes; cycling; art; sustainable consumption and the Earth Day. The article shows that the motives of the Fridays for Future movement are broad. We can demonstrate that Fridays for Future is connected to other social movements and gain insights into the everyday life of the Fridays for Future stakeholders. © The Author(s) 2022.},

  abstract = {Understanding social movement structures is important for political decision-makers to enable them to recognise the various motivating factors behind these movements. The Fridays for Future movement characterises a political group that has a majority of young people, frequently using social media to organise actions. By conducting a social network analysis on hashtags, this study contributes to the understanding of the global Fridays for Future movement. Particularly, we focus on the use and connection of hashtags on Instagram. We collected 59,112 posts tagged with \#fridaysforfuture and analysed 91,172 hashtags used therein. Subsequently, the 140 most used hashtags were divided into 11 clusters, which provide not only information about the organisation of the social movement via social media, but also insights into lifestyle-related aspects. The clusters include the topics: climate; nutrition, lifestyle and health; memes; cycling; art; sustainable consumption and the Earth Day. The article shows that the motives of the Fridays for Future movement are broad. We can demonstrate that Fridays for Future is connected to other social movements and gain insights into the everyday life of the Fridays for Future stakeholders. © The Author(s) 2022.},

  abstract = {The decolonizing turn in the humanities and social sciences calls for scholarship that analyzes social media practices through the lens of Indigenous epistemologies. In this article, we model the ways that Indigenous epistemologies might contribute to theories of social media practices as we explore ways that the digital image can drive identification with and engagement in political acts. The article analyzes social media tropes circulated across various platforms among Indigenous communities and allies in relation to the \#NoDAPL movement. We argue that attempting to analyze Native American traditions through Western theory will only work towards colonizing these Indigenous texts. Thus, whereas we employ insights from digital and visual methods of analysis (Highfield, T., \& Leaver, T.~(2016). Instagrammatics and digital methods: Studying visual social media, from selfies and GIFs to memes and emoji. Communication Research and Practice, 2(1), 47–62), we also highlight the strategic use of humor in the visual materials shared through various social media platforms utilizing the framework of the Trickster. We argue that the visual and digital phenomena we studied might best be understood as a form of digital survivance, drawing upon Anishinaabe scholar Gerald Vizenor [(1994). Manifest manners: Postindian warriors of survivance. Hanover, CT: Wesleyan University Press]. term ‘survivance’ as a portmanteau that combines ‘survival’ and ‘resistance’ in its characterization of Indigenous storytelling traditions. Whereas centering the Indigenous figure of the Trickster might suggest that social media has failed to live up to its promises, this epistemological approach also explains the hope that Indigenous communities hold in uniting via social media for what has been and continues to be a long-term battle for sovereignty and for the protection of the earth and all of its beings. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

  abstract = {The decolonizing turn in the humanities and social sciences calls for scholarship that analyzes social media practices through the lens of Indigenous epistemologies. In this article, we model the ways that Indigenous epistemologies might contribute to theories of social media practices as we explore ways that the digital image can drive identification with and engagement in political acts. The article analyzes social media tropes circulated across various platforms among Indigenous communities and allies in relation to the \#NoDAPL movement. We argue that attempting to analyze Native American traditions through Western theory will only work towards colonizing these Indigenous texts. Thus, whereas we employ insights from digital and visual methods of analysis (Highfield, T., \& Leaver, T.~(2016). Instagrammatics and digital methods: Studying visual social media, from selfies and GIFs to memes and emoji. Communication Research and Practice, 2(1), 47–62), we also highlight the strategic use of humor in the visual materials shared through various social media platforms utilizing the framework of the Trickster. We argue that the visual and digital phenomena we studied might best be understood as a form of digital survivance, drawing upon Anishinaabe scholar Gerald Vizenor [(1994). Manifest manners: Postindian warriors of survivance. Hanover, CT: Wesleyan University Press]. term ‘survivance’ as a portmanteau that combines ‘survival’ and ‘resistance’ in its characterization of Indigenous storytelling traditions. Whereas centering the Indigenous figure of the Trickster might suggest that social media has failed to live up to its promises, this epistemological approach also explains the hope that Indigenous communities hold in uniting via social media for what has been and continues to be a long-term battle for sovereignty and for the protection of the earth and all of its beings. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

However, the one thing noticeably missing has been any kind of proper debate over the validity of a concept regarded by many as scientifically suspect." "Darwinizing culture: the status of memetics as a science pits leading intellectuals (both supporters and opponents of meme theory) against each other to battle it out, and state their case. With a Foreword by Daniel Dennett, and contributions from Dan Sperber, David Hull, Robert Boyd, Susan Blackmore, Henry Plotkin, and others, the result is a thrilling and challenging debate that will perhaps mark a turning point for the field, and for future research."--Jacket.},

  abstract = {Social media are increasingly important in protest movements for communication and organization. As such, scholars should consider these ephemeral messages as a tool for understanding such movements’ rhetoric. This article draws on Kjeldsen’s method for the critique of visual political rhetoric and adds consideration of intertextuality, synecdoche, and metaphor to demonstrate a method for the rhetorical analysis and a critique of Internet memes as visual, political rhetoric. The Pepper Spray Cop meme arising from Occupy Wall Street is presented as a case-study example. The article considers the centrality of the intertextual nature of memes as a unique form of visual rhetoric in activist contexts and contributes to the literature on user-generated and activist rhetoric. © 2016 Central States Communication Association.},

  abstract = {This article explores user motivations for sharing and creating internet memes in a crisis situation. For this purpose, we investigate the kitten memes in \#Brusselslockdown on Twitter, following the Brussels security lockdown in November 2015 that resulted from information about potential terrorist attacks. We use a social network analysis to identify three user groups: content producers, content sharers, and conversationalists. On the basis of interviews with users from these three groups, we argue that the motivations for sharing and creating memes range from personal involvement in the crisis situation to acts of resistance to creative self-realization. We conclude by arguing that a combination of motifs and activities employ the visuality of internet memes to express popular internet culture, resistance, and solidarity as well as a humorous means of coping with the crisis situation. As a form of solidarity beyond the political, internet memes create tension between a crisis event, the mundane, terror, resistance, and humor. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

  abstract = {A variety of fan-based wikis about episodic fiction (e.g., television shows, novels, movies) exist on the World Wide Web. These wikis provide a wealth of information about complex stories, but if fans are behind in their viewing they run the risk of encountering “spoilers”—information that gives away key plot points before the intended time of the show’s writers. Because the wiki history is indexed by revisions, finding specific dates can be tedious, especially for pages with hundreds or thousands of edits. A wiki’s history interface does not permit browsing across historic pages without visiting current ones, thus revealing spoilers in the current page. Enterprising fans can resort to web archives and navigate there across wiki pages that were live prior to a specific episode date. In this paper, we explore the use of Memento with the Internet Archive as a means of avoiding spoilers in fan wikis. We conduct two experiments: one to determine the probability of encountering a spoiler when using Memento with the Internet Archive for a given wiki page, and a second to determine which date prior to an episode to choose when trying to avoid spoilers for that specific episode. Our results indicate that the Internet Archive is not safe for avoiding spoilers, and therefore we highlight the inherent capability of fan wikis to address the spoiler problem internally using existing, off-the-shelf technology. We use the spoiler use case to define and analyze different ways of discovering the best past version of a resource to avoid spoilers. We propose Memento as a structural solution to the problem, distinguishing it from prior content-based solutions to the spoiler problem. This research promotes the idea that content management systems can benefit from exposing their version information in the standardized Memento way used by other archives. We support the idea that there are use cases for which specific prior versions of web resources are invaluable. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract = {Sharenting, or the practice of sharing one’s parenting or information about one’s children on social media, occurs in an increasingly platformized digital culture, where visual formats are central across participatory and commercial repositories. This paper investigates the articulation between sharenting as performed by celebrities and the wider construction of children’s digital identities. Through qualitative content analysis, this research looks at how Cristiano Ronaldo, the most-followed individual on Instagram since 2018, his partner, and his mother shared information about his children on that social media platform between 2018 and 2020. Through manual exploration, we searched for Ronaldo’s children across a variety of digital spaces. Our analysis reveals that sharenting on Instagram engages audiences through the portrayal of children as the parents’ extended self. Content from Instagram and news media is appropriated in vernacular and commercial digital spaces for conflicting affects: the cute father-son dyad, and the son as extension of the uber-famous, vain father. This extreme case shows how the digital identities of children of celebrities are widely public, formed by the everyday, intimate content of the family’s life, which is persistent and collectively recreated by news media, vernacular culture, and commercial platforms. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

  abstract = {Sharenting, or the practice of sharing one’s parenting or information about one’s children on social media, occurs in an increasingly platformized digital culture, where visual formats are central across participatory and commercial repositories. This paper investigates the articulation between sharenting as performed by celebrities and the wider construction of children’s digital identities. Through qualitative content analysis, this research looks at how Cristiano Ronaldo, the most-followed individual on Instagram since 2018, his partner, and his mother shared information about his children on that social media platform between 2018 and 2020. Through manual exploration, we searched for Ronaldo’s children across a variety of digital spaces. Our analysis reveals that sharenting on Instagram engages audiences through the portrayal of children as the parents’ extended self. Content from Instagram and news media is appropriated in vernacular and commercial digital spaces for conflicting affects: the cute father-son dyad, and the son as extension of the uber-famous, vain father. This extreme case shows how the digital identities of children of celebrities are widely public, formed by the everyday, intimate content of the family’s life, which is persistent and collectively recreated by news media, vernacular culture, and commercial platforms. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

  abstract = {Scientific thought is characterized in general as methodical and rational. I would like to present here an opposing view, which treats science as a non-systematic activity, where serendipity, tinkering and imitation, rather than so-called rational thought, characterizes it. All these kinds of acts, which are considered to be a-rational, are related to an evolutionary view of science. Here I deal with a version of evolutionary epistemology as applied to science, integrated with the concept of ‘meme’. Richard Dawkins, who coined the term, treats memes as units of information that propagate in the meme pool by leaping from brain to brain. Memetics is the counterpart of genetics in the cultural arena. In its application to science, it deals with the manner in which memes/ideas spread in scientific communities. Memes (ideas) replicate through imitation. Examples of this phenomenon in science are illustrated by some historical cases. In particular, I deal with the evolution of theories of ‘internal symmetries’ in particle physics. © The Author(s) 2014.},

  abstract = {This paper offers the first systematic analysis of ‘digital memetic nonsense’– clusters of seemingly meaningless digital texts imitated and circulated by many participants. We evaluated this phenomenon through two conceptual lenses: theories on nonsense in the pre-digital age and the techno-cultural conditions that facilitate its contemporary formations. A grounded analysis of 139 nonsensical memes led to their typology into 5 genres: linguistic silliness, embodied silliness, pastiche, dislocations, and interruptions. In each of these genres, we show how digital nonsense may potentially serve as a social glue that bonds members of phatic, image-oriented, communities. If, in the past, nonsense was depicted in both intellectual terms, as defiant deconstruction of meaning, and in playful/social terms, its current memetic manifestations lean heavily toward the latter. Rather than being a reflection on ‘referential meaning’, digital nonsense is analyzed as a generative source of ‘affective meaning’ that marks the formation of social connections preceding cognitive understanding. We conclude by highlighting the potentially subversive implications of this shift for participatory barriers and community membership. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

  abstract = {Inaccessible Web pages and 404 "Page Not Found" responses are a common Web phenomenon and a detriment to the user's browsing experience. The rediscovery of missing Web pages is, therefore, a relevant research topic in the digital preservation as well as in the Information Retrieval realm. In this article, we bring these two areas together by analyzing four content- and link-based methods to rediscover missing Web pages. We investigate the retrieval performance of the methods individually as well as their combinations and give an insight into how effective these methods are over time. As the main result of this work, we are able to recommend not only the best performing methods but also the sequence in which they should be applied, based on their performance, complexity required to generate them, and evolution over time. Our least complex single method results in a rediscovery rate of almost 70\% of Web pages of our sample dataset based on URIs sampled from the Open Directory Project (DMOZ). By increasing the complexity level and combining three different methods, our results show an increase of the success rate of up to 77\%. The results, based on our sample dataset, indicate that Web pages are often not completely lost but have moved to a different location and "just" need to be rediscovered. © 2014 The Author(s).},

  abstract = {Books and their reviews are considered to be central to knowledge dissemination in the social sciences and humanities. Despite this perceive importance, few studies have assessed the relative importance of these document types in the dissemination of knowledge. This paper aims at better understanding the place of book reviews in the scholarly communication system and to shed light--through the analysis of books on Canada, United Kingdom and United States and their reviewers--on the international circulation of ideas in the social sciences and humanities. Based on 1,675,999 book reviews indexed in the Social Science Citation Index and Arts and Humanities Citation Index over the 1975-2016 period, our results show that book reviews are decreasing in importance in all disciplines-especially those where books have historically been peripheral. We also observe a high rate of homophily between reviewers and reviewed books, with researchers being primarily interested in the books that have been written by someone from their own country. Hence, despite the now widely held assumptions of the globalization of science, social science and humanities remains a highly localized activity. © 2019, Canadian Journal of Sociology. Les monographies et leur comptes rendus sont considérés comme étant importants véhicules de diffusion des connaissances dans les sciences sociales et humaines. Malgré cette importance perçue, peu d'études ont mesuré l'importance relative de ces types de documents dans le processus de diffusion des connaissances. Cet article vise à mieux comprendre la place des comptes rendus de monographies dans le système de diffusion des connaissances et à révéler-à travers l'analyse des monographies sur le Canada, les états-Unis et le Royaume-Uni et de leurs comptes rendus-la circulation internationale des idées dans les sciences sociales et humaines. Basé sur 1,675,999 comptes rendus indexés par le Social Science Citation Index et le Arts and Humanities Citation Index au cours de la période 1975-2016, nos résultats montrent que les comptes rendus sont en décroissance dans l'ensemble des disciplines-et spécialement dans celles où ces types de documents sont plus périphériques. Nous observons également d'importants taux d'homophilie entre les auteurs des comptes rendus les nations étudiés dans les monographies, avec une majorité des comptes rendus réalisés par des auteurs venant du même pays que celui étant étudié dans la monographie. Ainsi, malgré les discours sur la globalisation de l'activité scientifique, les sciences sociales et humaines demeurent hautement localisées. © 2019, Canadian Journal of Sociology.},

  abstract = {While existing scholarship has focused on distilling the attributes of successful memes and the dynamics of their propagation in online spaces, there is a lack of research on the vernacular criticism of memes beyond quantitative markers of popularity. By examining the MemeEconomy community on Reddit, where ‘meme traders’ appropriate stock market terminology to discuss and appraise memes, this article aims to understand how this particular subculture of self-proclaimed meme insiders assigns value to viral media. Our findings point to the salience of four key features that are seen to determine a meme’s value: its positioning in relation to the mainstream, its versatility and expansion potential, its topicality or cultural relevance, and its perceived quality. We discuss implications for the formation and reinforcement of subcultural identities around memes, and theorize the role of vernacular criticism as fulfilling significant social functions in online communities. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

  date = {1996},

  location = {New York, NY},
  abstract = {What characterizes a meme is its capacity for displacing rival ideas and beliefs in an evolutionary drama that determines and changes the way people think. Exactly how do ideas spread, and what are the factors that make them genuine thought contagions? Why, for instance, do some beliefs spread throughout society, while others dwindle to extinction? What drives those intensely held beliefs that spawn ideological and political debates such as views on abortion and opinions about sex and sexuality?By drawing on examples from everyday life, Lynch develops a conceptual basis for understanding memetics. Memes evolve by natural selection in a process similar to that of Genes in evolutionary biology. What makes an idea a potent meme is how effectively it out-propagates other ideas. In memetic evolution, the "fittest ideas" are not always the truest or the most helpful, but the ones best at self replication. Thus, crash diets spread not because of lasting benefit, but by alternating episodes of dramatic weight loss and slow regain. Each sudden thinning provokes onlookers to ask, "How did you do it?" thereby manipulating them to experiment with the diet and in turn, spread it again. The faster the pounds return, the more often these people enter that disseminating phase, all of which favors outbreaks of the most pathogenic diets. Like a software virus traveling on the Internet or a flu strain passing through a city, thought contagions proliferate by programming for their own propagation. Lynch argues that certain beliefs spread like viruses and evolve like microbes, as mutant strains vie for more adherents and more hosts. In its most revolutionary aspect, memetics asks not how people accumulate ideas, but how ideas accumulate people. Readers of this intriguing theory will be amazed to discover that many popular beliefs about family, sex, politics, religion, health, and war have succeeded by their "fitness" as thought contagions.

  abstract = {Knowledge flow between disciplines is typically measured through citations among publications. In this study, we quantify cross-disciplinary knowledge diffusion from the novel perspective of content by introducing knowledge memes, a special type of knowledge unit. Diffusion cascade is proposed to model the diffusion process of knowledge memes. By taking Medical Informatics (MI) as an exemplary interdisciplinary discipline, we measure the knowledge relationships between it and four related disciplines. The diffusion patterns of cross-disciplinary memes are also identified by analyzing the network structure of the diffusion cascade. The results present the knowledge relationships among disciplines measured by knowledge memes, which are different from those measured by citations. It is shown that preferential attachment takes effect in cross-disciplinary knowledge meme diffusion. In addition, cross-disciplinary knowledge memes generally originate earlier and have higher impact than the memes of MI. This study provides insights into new approaches to quantifying knowledge relationships among disciplines and furthers the understanding of content diffusion mechanisms through measurable knowledge units. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {The objective of this paper is to provide a non-technical introduction to the science of memetics and to suggest how this new discipline may be applied to the design and development of effective marketing campaigns. The technique is based on a neo-Darwinian evolutionary model of information transmission that may be used to explain and predict the “infectiousness” of certain ideas and behaviours. It is argued that traditional marketing theories based on rational choice theory may rely on an impossible homuncular psychology and it is suggested that a viable alternative would be to understand customer behaviour from a memetic perspective - the result of contagion rather than conscious choice. From the memetic paradigm the role of marketing communications becomes one of designing and engineering infectious “mind viruses” that will influence customer perceptions and behaviour. Whilst memetics is still in its infancy, it is suggested that memetic engineering may provide a viable and effective complementary framework to standard techniques for developing successful marketing strategies. © 1998, MCB UP Limited},

  abstract = {Cathy Marshall of Microsoft Research, studies and analyses the portions of the Twitter feed, that is Big Data. During the study, the author sampled the Twitter data, labeled the tweets, analyzed the data, and added a secondary data source. According to the official Twitter blog, as of March 2012, 140 million active users produce about 340 million tweets per day. Most of them lookout for celebrity gossip, for humor and inspiration, for photos, for tidbits to which they could attach their own names and turn into memes. Big data refers to the rising flood of digital data from many sources, including the Web, biological and industrial sensors, video, e-mail and social network communications. There are no particular limits as to size, media type, genre, source, or the degree of curatorial attention they receive. Big Data reminds us that privacy problems are far from solved, and that there's an enormous gap between theory and practice.},

  abstract = {This study examines ETDs deposited during the period 2011-2015 in an institutional repository, to determine the degree to which the documents suffer from reference rot, that is, linkrot plus content drift. The authors converted and examined 664 doctoral dissertations in total, extracting 11,437 links, finding overall that 77\% of links were active, and 23\% exhibited linkrot. A stratified random sample of 49 ETDs was performed which produced 990 active links, which were then checked for content drift based on mementos found in the Wayback Machine. Mementos were found for 77\% of links, and approximately half of these, 492 of 990, exhibited content drift. The results serve to emphasize not only the necessity of broader awareness of this problem, but also to stimulate action on the preservation front.},

  abstract = {Regulatory sequence detection is a critical facet for understanding the cell mechanisms in order to coordinate the response to stimuli. Protein synthesis involves the binding of a transcription factor to specific sequences in a process related to the gene expression initiation. A characteristic of this binding process is that the same factor binds with different sequences placed along all genome. Thus, any computational approach shows many difficulties related with this variability observed from the binding sequences. This paper proposes the detection of transcription factor binding sites based on a parametric uncertainty measurement (Rényi entropy). This detection algorithm evaluates the variation on the total Rnyi entropy of a set of sequences when a candidate sequence is assumed to be a true binding site belonging to the set. The efficiency of the method is measured in form of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves on different transcription factors from Saccharomyces cerevisiae organism. The results are compared with other known motif detection algorithms such as Motif Discovery scan (MDscan) and multiple expectationmaximization (EM) for motif elicitation (MEME). © 2006 IEEE.},

  abstract = {The period following the social mobilizations of 2011 has seen a renewed focus on the place of communication in collective action, linked to the increasing importance of digital communications. Framed in terms of personalized ‘connective action’ or the social morphology of networks, these analyses have criticized previously dominant models of ‘collective identity’, arguing that collective action needs to be understood as ‘digital networking’. These influential approaches have been significantly constructed as a response to models of communication and action evident in the rise of Independent Media Centres in the period following 1999. After considering the rise of the ‘digital networking’ paradigm linked to analyses of Indymedia, this article considers the emergence of the internet-based collaboration known as Anonymous, focusing on its origins on the 4chan manga site and its 2008 campaign against Scientology, and also considers the ‘I am the 99\%’ microblog that emerged as part of the Occupy movement. The emergence of Anonymous highlights dimensions of digital culture such as the ephemeral, the importance of memes, an ethic of lulz, the mask and the grotesque. These forms of communication are discussed in the light of dominant attempts to shape digital space in terms of radical transparency, the knowable and the calculable. It is argued that these contrasting approaches may amount to opposing social models of an emerging information society, and that the analysis of contemporary conflicts and mobilizations needs to be alert to novel forms of communicative practice at work in digital cultures today. © 2015 Taylor \& Francis.},

  abstract = {Current research on visual media and the far right creates two expectations: that memes play an increasingly salient role in the far right’s digital visual culture, and that the visual and participatory dimensions of internet culture facilitate greater transnationality. We explore these expectations with a comparative research design, situating memes in relation to other genres of visual content and across different country contexts. Taking a mixed methods approach, this article examines the digital visual culture of 25 far-right alternative media and other non-party organisations in Australia, Italy, Germany, and the United States. We assess the salience of memes and other visual genres, as well as three forms of transnationality: the circulation of images, direct communicative references, and transnational similarities. Unexpectedly, we find that memes play only a limited role in the digital visual culture of far-right non-party organisations, with their uneven concentration in Anglophone alt-media suggesting the potential pitfalls of assumptions about ‘global’ internet culture. We also find little evidence of transnationality through the circulation of the same visuals across countries, whether memes or other genres. Instead, transnationality works through transnational references within the images themselves and through more parallel practices of reproducing visuals in similar ways with similar themes, but with elements specific to an organisation’s national and political context. Within this, we identify three distinct visual discourses–fascist continuity, western civilisational identity, and pop cultural appropriation–which highlight different practices of transnationality and collective identity construction within the far right online. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

  abstract = {The 22 May 2017 bombing of the Manchester Arena, which killed 22 and injured over 800 more, triggered a massive public response leading to, among other things, improvised memorials, spontaneous vigils, dedicated hashtags, and viral videos. Within this response, the memetic reinvigoration and, subsequently, brand adoption of one of Manchester’s oldest civic symbols–the worker bee–was clearly discernible. In this article, we explore how the spread of the bee after the bombing contributed to a politics of post-terror togetherness. Conceptualising memes as ‘more or less digital’, we ‘follow’ the bee across bodies, streets and social media platforms via the analysis of approximately 53,000 Instagram images. We show how the initial memeification of the bee carried with it grassroots expressions of togetherness while the subsequent use of the bee in official city branding strategies created and obfuscated various political tensions. © 2021 The Author(s).

In 'The World Made Meme', Ryan Milner argues that memes, and the memetic process, are shaping public conversation. It's hard to imagine a major pop cultural or political moment that doesn't generate a constellation of memetic texts.},

  abstract = {It was late February 2020 when part of Northern Italy entered the first Covid-19 lockdown of the West. While stories of people fleeing quarantined areas soon made national headlines, the international news was suddenly reporting of coronavirus patients connected to Italy all around the world. Against this background, Italian social media started thriving with Covid-19 humour. On 9 March the lockdown turned nationwide and became one of the strictest in Europe. This article addresses everyday memes of quarantined Italy as an instance of mundane memetics at a time of crisis. It investigates the leading discourses emerging from these memes to provide insight into the political culture that surfaces at the intersection between the ordinary of everyday social media uses and the extraordinary of crisis events. We combined digital methods and netnographic techniques to generate and analyse a dataset of over 9,000 Covid-19 memetic instances produced on Twitter by Italian publics during the first national lockdown. Our findings show that in early everyday pandemic memes the political stake did not manifest itself in the explicitness of values, attitudes, and knowledge tightly packaged in a purposeful and self-aware political culture. It rather surfaced in the form of a mundane political culture–one that was primarily performative, irrespective of any future political action, and marked by populist values. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates a collective of websleuths called the Reddit Bureau of Investigation (RBI) that contains over 70,000 members. Websleuthing, or the investigative practices undertaken online by individuals who are not professional security providers, is an increasing trend. While conducting investigations on Reddit constitutes somewhat of a transgressive practice, the online platform's history is intimately linked with websleuthing since the manhunt that followed the 2013 Boston attacks which received much criticism from its community. Thus, we seek to understand how the RBI organizes its investigative activities against an anti-vigilante backdrop. Drawing from organizational discourse theory, we analyze the discursive practices developed by RBI members to define and enforce the collective's mission and participatory guidelines. Specifically, we focus on the figures (memes, metaphors, rules, affects, etc.) that RBI members invoke in interaction and on the role of Reddit's affordances in the materialization of these discursive entities. Our analysis is threefold. First, we underline how figures associated with retributive vigilantism are invoked by moderators and their propension to circumscribe what (not) to do within the subreddit. Then, we analyze a series of controversial posts to identify the recurring discursive practices developed by users when asking the RBI for assistance. Finally, we explore the ambivalent rapport that RBI members maintain with the police. Overall, our analysis shows that members must overtly recognize police authority over criminal matters yet invoke the institution's limitations to justify their involvement in the RBI, all the while rejecting any association with retributive vigilantism. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates a collective of websleuths called the Reddit Bureau of Investigation (RBI) that contains over 70,000 members. Websleuthing, or the investigative practices undertaken online by individuals who are not professional security providers, is an increasing trend. While conducting investigations on Reddit constitutes somewhat of a transgressive practice, the online platform's history is intimately linked with websleuthing since the manhunt that followed the 2013 Boston attacks which received much criticism from its community. Thus, we seek to understand how the RBI organizes its investigative activities against an anti-vigilante backdrop. Drawing from organizational discourse theory, we analyze the discursive practices developed by RBI members to define and enforce the collective's mission and participatory guidelines. Specifically, we focus on the figures (memes, metaphors, rules, affects, etc.) that RBI members invoke in interaction and on the role of Reddit's affordances in the materialization of these discursive entities. Our analysis is threefold. First, we underline how figures associated with retributive vigilantism are invoked by moderators and their propension to circumscribe what (not) to do within the subreddit. Then, we analyze a series of controversial posts to identify the recurring discursive practices developed by users when asking the RBI for assistance. Finally, we explore the ambivalent rapport that RBI members maintain with the police. Overall, our analysis shows that members must overtly recognize police authority over criminal matters yet invoke the institution's limitations to justify their involvement in the RBI, all the while rejecting any association with retributive vigilantism. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

  abstract = {This study uses meme templates as a lens for exploring cultural globalization. By conceptualizing such templates as expressive repertoires that simultaneously enable and limit expression, we examined global and local dimensions of mainstream meme culture. We traced the top 100 templates in meme generators in English, German, Spanish, and Chinese, using 10 examples to typify each (n = 4000). Combining quantitative and qualitative analysis, we examined the forms, social identities, and emotions embedded in these templates. Our findings demonstrated that whereas meme templates are dominated by American/Western pop culture, local templates are also evident, especially in Chinese. Overall, memes are socially conservative yet emotionally disruptive; while they align with hegemonic representation patterns, their emotional palette tilts toward the negative, with anger as a major anchor and happiness expressed ironically. Finally, our findings suggested an individualism–collectivism puzzle, wherein emotions in memes seem to contradict the existing literature on cultural values. © The Author(s) 2018.},

  abstract = {When the COVID-19 pandemic triggered a global health crisis in early 2020, memes of populist political leaders were disseminated in abundance on social media. At first sight, these political memes satirized and exposed the hazardous actions, appearances and communicative strategies of the populist leaders in this unforeseen situation that not only unsettled existing power balances, but also standard modes of professional and personal conduct. Based on a thematic analysis of memes of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and US President Donald Trump during the COVID-19 crisis, this paper finds, however, that the political memes’ critical and affirmative power conflated. This challenged their potential as counter-narratives to the actions and communication of these populist leaders. We argue that this can be explained by an overlap in the communicative form of populism and memes: Political memes are a social media genre that uses incongruent humor to expose the contradictions, conflicts and hypocrisy of populist politicians. Similarly, populist politicians communicate in polarizing and personalizing rhetoric that emphasizes conflicts and the mischiefs of others on social media and beyond. This raises the broader question of how populist leaders might be criticized and their actions subjected to scrutiny in political memes without feeding into their own communicative patterns and logics, and thus unintentionally confirming their worldview and interpretations of events. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

  abstract = {Social media technologies like Twitter are credited with enabling a new form of connective action, in which political movements coalesce and mobilise around hashtags, memes and personalised action frames. After the UK riots in 2011, citizen ‘broom armies’ took to the streets to clear up and repair damage. Different hashtags, including \#RiotCleanUp and \#OperationCupOfTea, were implicated in these movements. This paper questions connective action theory in this context. It seeks to respond to two criticisms of the connective approach, namely that connective action underplays differences between technologies and does not account sufficiently for cultural and ideological drivers of action. The paper combines an analysis of software systems, issue publics and discourse to giver a fuller account of connective politics during the riot clean-up movements. In doing so, it develops several metrics to advance understanding of digital communication systems, drawing attention to the roles that time and account status play in assembling meaning on Twitter. This analysis suggests that the clean-up movements were complex, discursive political acts, in which celebrity accounts played an influential role in framing discourse. Furthermore, the \#RiotCleanUp hashtag credited with mobilising these groups is found to provide a less compelling explanation of action when compared against the more emotive but less noted \#OperationCupOfTea. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

  abstract = {Advocacy campaigns opposing the Stop Online Piracy Act and the Anti-counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) illustrate that the dynamics of networked activism have symbolic as well as structural aspects, with implications for scholars and activists who have focused on the coordination possibilities of networks. This paper analyses the creation and movement of discourses of ‘network exceptionalism’ between advocates, online culture and news media. Networks operate functionally to disseminate ideas and link together people participating in social action (e.g. by embedding aspects of discourse in memes, which then propagate ideas swiftly), but also symbolically, inflecting discourses towards a focus on the exceptional – and essential – qualities of the internet. These discourses embed fears about the fragility and indispensability of the internet, as well as thrilling and threatening elements like Anonymous. They are carried by memes that link the structural dynamics of networked activism to the discourses of illness, threat and utility, and gain different inflections through the European campaigns to oppose ACTA. These discourses not only create spaces for discussing and expanding upon the value of the internet to communication rights, but also leave room for interpretations that may undermine these advocacy projects. © 2015 Taylor \& Francis.},

  abstract = {Advocacy campaigns opposing the Stop Online Piracy Act and the Anti-counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) illustrate that the dynamics of networked activism have symbolic as well as structural aspects, with implications for scholars and activists who have focused on the coordination possibilities of networks. This paper analyses the creation and movement of discourses of ‘network exceptionalism’ between advocates, online culture and news media. Networks operate functionally to disseminate ideas and link together people participating in social action (e.g. by embedding aspects of discourse in memes, which then propagate ideas swiftly), but also symbolically, inflecting discourses towards a focus on the exceptional – and essential – qualities of the internet. These discourses embed fears about the fragility and indispensability of the internet, as well as thrilling and threatening elements like Anonymous. They are carried by memes that link the structural dynamics of networked activism to the discourses of illness, threat and utility, and gain different inflections through the European campaigns to oppose ACTA. These discourses not only create spaces for discussing and expanding upon the value of the internet to communication rights, but also leave room for interpretations that may undermine these advocacy projects. © 2015 Taylor \& Francis.},

This debate has occurred in the absence of a defined mental viral structure or a target body upon which such viral structures may act. This article develops a paradigm in which the self is understood as such a body upon which future research into “mind viruses” may be undertaken. Possible mechanisms for mind-viral transmission are discussed. Criteria for defining a mental virus are used to examine evidence of possible mind-virus contagion in suicides, suicide cults, terrorism, and religion.},

  abstract = {Over more than a decade, Knowledge Management (KM) thinkers have been pondering over the need for a new chapter in the evolutionary history of KM. Will it just be a regeneration based on the integration and new alignment of the numerous metaphors employed for KM's past interpretations, or will it be - as Levy suggests - a decentralising revolution that gives more power and autonomy to individuals and self-organised groups? Inspired by the objective of this special JIKM issue, the paper adopts a current "Next KM Generation" concept and prototype-in-progress as a point of departure and reverse engineers its functionalities in order to crystallise those KM Models and Theories which - in terms of the concept to be introduced - have passed the test of time. Forty-eight KM constructs have been singled out which are the ingredients for the ongoing integrating, adapting, broadening, deepening, repurposing, and innovating activities of the Personalised KM concept and system design which has been transparently mapped and visualised utilising the Information-Space Model. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Co.},

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to examine a project where resource description framework (RDF) is expected to function both in the short term and over long periods. Because RDF is comparatively new, the library and information science literature has scarcely addressed the issues. The article analyses RDF from the perspective of the requirements for long term digital archiving, with special emphasis on the need for maintaining integrity and usability. RDF and RDFa (resource description framework in attributes) encoding can be archived, but the external references that make RDF function may change their meaning or vanish over time, unless efforts are made to archive them too and to provide timebased context information through mechanisms like Memento. RDFbased “triple store” databases can likewise be archived. The value of this article lies in its examination of how RDF and its variants will work within the constraints of current long term digital archiving systems. RDF is relatively new, but its proponents see it as a long term enhancement of the web and of internetconnected projects. This requires some consideration about how it will function in 100 years or more. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

  abstract = {Memes are small units of culture, analogous to genes, which flow from person to person by copying or imitation. More than any previous medium, the Internet has the technical capabilities for global même diffusion. Yet, to spread globally, memes need to negotiate their way through cultural and linguistic borders. This article introduces a new broad method, Web memetics, comprising extensive Web searches and combined quantitative and qualitative analyses, to identify and assess: (a) the different versions of a meme, (b) its evolution online, and (c) its Web presence and translation into common Internet languages. This method is demonstrated through one extensively circulated joke about men, women, and computers. The results show that the joke has mutated into several different versions and is widely translated, and that translations incorporate small, local adaptations while retaining the English versions' fundamental components. In conclusion, Web memetics has demonstrated its ability to identify and track the evolution and spread of mêmes online, with interesting results, albeit for only one case study. © 2009 ASIS\&T.},

'Gangnam Style' (and its attendant parodies, imitations, and derivations)is one of the most famous examples of an Internet meme: a piece of digital content that spreads quickly around the Web in various iterations and becomes a shared cultural experience. In this book, the author investigates Internet memes and what they tell us about digital culture. She discusses a series of well-known Internet memes, including 'Leave Britney Alone,' the pepper-spraying cop, LOLCats, Scumbag Steve, and Occupy Wall Street's 'We Are the 99 Percent.' She differentiates memes from virals; analyzes what makes memes and virals successful; describes popular meme genres; discusses memes as new modes of political participation in democratic and nondemocratic regimes; and examines memes as agents of globalization. Memes, the author argues, encapsulate some of the most fundamental aspects of the Internet in general and of the participatory Web 2.0 culture in particular. Internet memes may be entertaining, but in this book, the author makes a compelling argument for taking them seriously.--adapted from publisher's description.Contents: Introduction --; A telegraphic biography of a conceptual troublemaker --; When memes go digital --; Defining Internet memes --; Memes versus virals --; Unpacking viral and memetic success --; Meme genres --; May the excessive force be with you : memes as political participation --; When Internet memes go global --; Future directions for Internet meme research.Access: Materials specified:    ebraryhttp://site.ebrary.com/id/10776345Materials specified: EBSCOhosthttps://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true\&scope=site\&db=nlebk\&db=nlabk\&AN=649171Materials specified: IEEE Xplorehttp://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/bkabstractplus.jsp?bkn=6658626Materials specified: IEEE Xplorehttp://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?bknumber=6658626Materials specified: IEEE Xplorehttps://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/bkabstractplus.jsp?bkn=6658626Materials specified: JSTORhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/j.ctt14bs14sMaterials specified: MIT Presshttp://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262525435Materials specified: MIT Presshttps://doi.org/10.7551/mitpress/9429.001.0001Materials specified: MyiLibraryhttp://www.myilibrary.com?id=530086Materials specified: OverDrivehttps://www.overdrive.com/search?q=5F811382-EF5A-48DF-80E4-5995BAF5D8C3Materials specified: ProQuest Ebook Centralhttps://public.ebookcentral.proquest.com/choice/publicfullrecord.aspx?p=3339690Materials specified: Scholars Portal Bookshttp://www.library.yorku.ca/e/resolver/id/2665820http: //www.library.yorku.ca/e/resolver/id/2665821http: //www.library.yorku.ca/e/resolver/id/2845683Materials specified: Excerptshttps://samples.overdrive.com/memes-in-digital?.epub-sample.overdrive.comMaterials specified: Imagehttp://images.contentreserve.com/ImageType-100/3505-1/\{5F811382-EF5A-48DF-80E4-5995BAF5D8C3\}Img100.jpghttp: //www.vlebooks.com/vleweb/product/openreader?id=none\&isbn=9780262317702http: //www.vlebooks.com/vleweb/product/openreader?id=none\&isbn=9780262317696Identifier: INFORMATION SCIENCE/Internet StudiesNote(s): Includes bibliographical references (pages 179-189) and index.General Info: Other format available: Print version:; Shifman, Limor, 1974-; Memes in digital culture.; Cambridge, Massachusetts : The MIT Press, [2014]Class Descriptors: LC: HM626; Dewey: 302; UDC:                    316.734:004.738.5Responsibility: Limor Shifman.Vendor Info: Askews and Holts Library Services Askews and Holts Library Services Coutts Information Services EBL - Ebook Library ebrary EBSCOhost ProQuest MyiLibrary Digital eBook Collection YBP Library Services (ASKH ASKH COUT EBLB EBRY EBSC IDEB YANK)Material Type: Document (dct); Internet resource (url); eBook (ebk)Date of Entry: 20131014Update: 20220406Provider: OCLC},

  abstract = {This paper re-examines the concept of "meme" in the context of digital culture. Defined as cultural units that spread from person to person, memes were debated long before the digital era. Yet the Internet turned the spread of memes into a highly visible practice, and the term has become an integral part of the netizen vernacular. After evaluating the promises and pitfalls of memes for understanding digital culture, I address the problem of defining memes by charting a communication-oriented typology of 3 memetic dimensions: content, form, and stance. To illustrate the utility of the typology, I apply it to analyze the video meme "Leave Britney Alone." Finally, I chart possible paths for further meme-oriented analysis of digital content. © 2013 International Communication Association.},

  abstract = {Hydride dissociation energy is of great importance in understanding the hydride-donating abilities of organic hydrides. Although the hydride dissociation energies of some organic hydrides have been experimentally measured, much less attention has been focused on the investigation of these quantities from the first principles of physics. Herein, we developed an ONIOM-G4 method and carefully benchmarked this new method against 48 experimental hydride dissociation energies of diverse bulky molecules. It was found that with the combined methods of the HF/6-31+G(d,p)//IEFPCM/ Bondi1.15 solvation model, the ONIOM-G4 method can predict the hydride dissociation energies with an error bar of only 1.7 kcal/mol. With the newly developed ONIOM-G4 method, we then systematically studied the hydride dissociation energies of six categories of biologically and pharmaceutically important six-membered heterocyclic organic hydrides, namely, the organic hydrides containing 1,4-dihydropyridine, 1,4-dihydropyrazine, 1,4-oxazine, 1,4-thiazine, 4H-pyran, and 4H-thiopyran ring structures. An extensive hydride dissociation energy scale containing over 100 six-memebered heterocyclic organic hydrides has been established, which may find applications in both synthetic organic chemistry and mechanistic studies of various chemical or biological processes involving transferring of the hydride anion. © 2011 American Chemical Society.},

  abstract = {Hydride dissociation energy is of great importance in understanding the hydride-donating abilities of organic hydrides. Although the hydride dissociation energies of some organic hydrides have been experimentally measured, much less attention has been focused on the investigation of these quantities from the first principles of physics. Herein, we developed an ONIOM-G4 method and carefully benchmarked this new method against 48 experimental hydride dissociation energies of diverse bulky molecules. It was found that with the combined methods of the HF/6-31+G(d,p)//IEFPCM/ Bondi1.15 solvation model, the ONIOM-G4 method can predict the hydride dissociation energies with an error bar of only 1.7 kcal/mol. With the newly developed ONIOM-G4 method, we then systematically studied the hydride dissociation energies of six categories of biologically and pharmaceutically important six-membered heterocyclic organic hydrides, namely, the organic hydrides containing 1,4-dihydropyridine, 1,4-dihydropyrazine, 1,4-oxazine, 1,4-thiazine, 4H-pyran, and 4H-thiopyran ring structures. An extensive hydride dissociation energy scale containing over 100 six-memebered heterocyclic organic hydrides has been established, which may find applications in both synthetic organic chemistry and mechanistic studies of various chemical or biological processes involving transferring of the hydride anion. © 2011 American Chemical Society.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Information scientists may find value in studying cultural information evolution and information diffusion through memetics. Information studies in memetics have often found datafication in memetics research difficult. Meanwhile, current memetic scholarship elsewhere is abundant in data due to their focus on Internet artifacts. This paper offers a way to close the datafication gap for information researchers by associating information data with “differences” between memetic documents. Design/methodology/approach: This work offers a joint theory and methodology invested in information-oriented memetics. This methodology of differences is developed from a content analysis of difference on a collection of images with visual similarities. Findings: The authors find that this kind of analysis provides a heuristic method for quantitatively bounding where one meme ends and another begins. The authors also find that this approach helps describe the dynamics of memetic media in such a way that the authors can datafy information or cultural evolution more clearly. Originality/value: Here the authors offer an approach for studying cultural information evolution through the study of memes. In doing so, the authors forward a methodology of difference which leverages content analysis in order to outline how it functions practically. The authors propose a quantitative methodology to assess differences between versions of document contents in order to examine what a particular meme is. The authors also move toward showing the information structure which defines a meme. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

  abstract = {Knowledge memes are the cultural equivalent of genes that play an important role in the evolution of knowledge. In this paper, we are trying to identify and tracking scientific and technological knowledge memes, and infer the relationship between science and technology at micro-level. A new carbon nanomaterial—graphene is taken as an example, and publications and patents are used as data sources for the representation of science and technology. Citation networks of publications and patents are constructed, on which a knowledge meme discovery algorithm is used, in order to identify memes that play a key role in the evolution of scientific and technological knowledge. Then the diffusion and co-occurrence of knowledge memes are shown, and a word embedding model is used to track the semantic change of the memes. The research could provide guidance for promoting knowledge innovation and making research policy. © 2018, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to review intuition in the context of organizational change. The authors argue that intuition as a concept requires attention and its formulation is necessary prior to its application in organizations. The paper provides a critique of dual process theory and highlights shortcomings in organization theorizing of intuition. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is conceptual and provides in-depth theoretical discussions by drawing from the literature on decision and intuition in the context of organizational change. Findings: Investigating whether dual process theory is sufficiently clear, the authors found ambiguity. Specifically, the current definition provided by Dane and Pratt is not clear in terms of its four sections: the consciousness of non-conscious processing, involving holistic associations, that are produced rapidly, which result in affectively charged judgments. Finally, the authors note that the evolutionary perspective is missing and they provide foundational concepts for such a perspective, including the discussion of information templates, memes and genes, as argued by research, condition intuition. Originality/value: The paper finds that an evolutionary perspective develops a picture of intuition as an adaptive resource. This evolutionary perspective is currently absent in research and the authors provide foundational concepts for such a perspective. They propose specific arguments to highlight the evolutionary perspective. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to review intuition in the context of organizational change. The authors argue that intuition as a concept requires attention and its formulation is necessary prior to its application in organizations. The paper provides a critique of dual process theory and highlights shortcomings in organization theorizing of intuition. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is conceptual and provides in-depth theoretical discussions by drawing from the literature on decision and intuition in the context of organizational change. Findings: Investigating whether dual process theory is sufficiently clear, the authors found ambiguity. Specifically, the current definition provided by Dane and Pratt is not clear in terms of its four sections: the consciousness of non-conscious processing, involving holistic associations, that are produced rapidly, which result in affectively charged judgments. Finally, the authors note that the evolutionary perspective is missing and they provide foundational concepts for such a perspective, including the discussion of information templates, memes and genes, as argued by research, condition intuition. Originality/value: The paper finds that an evolutionary perspective develops a picture of intuition as an adaptive resource. This evolutionary perspective is currently absent in research and the authors provide foundational concepts for such a perspective. They propose specific arguments to highlight the evolutionary perspective. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

  abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to investigate how Internet memes affect brand image. Design/methodology/approach: The authors first used the Delphi method to refine Internet memes' constructs and dimensions and developed a scale for Internet memes. Second, the authors used a questionnaire to collect data from 348 valid Internet consumers. Findings: The authors proposed four significant characteristics of Internet memes: humour, high positive emotional intensity, brand interactions and prestige, and high spreadability to prompt consumers to remake, share and spread memes. The study results indicate that Internet memes positively influence the brand image. However, not all meme characteristics were correlated with the brand image; only brand prestige, interaction and humour enhanced brand image. Originality/value: For scholars in online marketing communication research, this study shifts the current paradigm of brand-generated and customer-passive to user-generated and customer-active. It also addresses the importance of pandemic effects of Internet memes on brand image. To be specific, this study presents the important symbolic values that Internet memes need to include to affect consumers' behaviour in response to perceived brand image by applying both mind infection and symbolic value perspectives. Finally, this study redefines the dimensions and measurements of Internet memes to address the lack of consensus and concrete scales regarding meme transmission characteristics and extending into online marketing communication strategies.

  abstract = {This paper examines memetic content as a window into the values expressed by far-right constituents. Our main premise was that far-right memes are a site of interaction between two types of values: those of the far-right as a social movement and those characterizing memetic communication on social media. We studied this notion through a case from Italy: the photo-based meme genre of ‘alternative calendar commemorations’ that memorialize events or figures important to the far-right imaginary. A multi-modal qualitative analysis based on Schwartz’s theory of personal and political values yielded mixed results. As expected, we found strong appeals to collectivistic values such as patriotism and tradition. Yet some of the individualistic values associated with memes, such as self-direction and authenticity, were also evident in the corpus. We conclude by discussing how this blend of values challenges both well-established value theories and perceptions about the political work of far-right memes. © 2021 The Author(s).

  abstract = {'Advice animals' are popular user-created, image-based, and online meme formats. The memes include a humorous image of an animal juxtaposed with text offering advice and/or making a joke. One such example is known as 'Confession Bear', which features a sad looking Malayan sun bear 'confessing' to something silly, shameful, taboo, or embarrassing. Confession Bear was first circulated through the online community Reddit and was intended to be humorous. However, users unexpectedly started creating and sharing more serious confessions involving topics such as rape, abuse, and addiction. These more serious confessions juxtaposed with the Confession Bear image spurred lengthy in-depth conversations on the Reddit message boards about the validity, authenticity, and appropriateness of such confessions. Some users argued advice animals were not 'supposed' to be serious, claiming these confessions were an inappropriate use of the form; as such, some users attempted to regulate the participatory culture created by the production of image-based memes. Others sought to find the 'truth' in the claims; some argued the confessions were false and therefore inappropriate, while others defended the confessions as authentic, and therefore appropriate. This paper argues anonymity allows users to appropriate and repurpose humorous image-based memes in ways that simultaneously challenge and reproduce hegemonic culture. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor \& Francis.},

  abstract = {The Russia-Ukraine conflict of 2014 sparked political upheaval, military action, and the emergence of Internet memes as a forum for discursive critique among netizens of the affected countries. A qualitative content analysis was conducted of Internet memes posted to the RuNet Memes Twitter account in 2014 and revealed a preponderance of memes that fell into one of two categories: directionally Russian or directionally Ukrainian. Directionality as a thematic category is a novel methodological approach in memes research. While the memes reference a given news story or event, they continued to be consumed and reproduced along similar thematic categories. This tendency to follow a narrative is at once endemic to viral media in general and unique to memes given their remix, parody, iteration, and rapid diffusion. © 2016 Bradley E. Wiggins.},

This book explores cases of cultural, economic, and political critique levied by the purposeful production and consumption of internet memes. Often images, animated GIFs, or videos are remixed in such a way to incorporate intertextual references, quite frequently to popular culture, alongside a joke or critique of some aspect of the human experience. Ideology, semiotics, and intertextuality coalesce in the book's argument that internet memes represent a new form of meaning-making, and the rapidity by which they are produced and spread underscores their importance.},

  abstract = {A tenable genre development of Internet memes is introduced in three categories to describe memetic transformation: spreadable media, emergent meme, and meme. We argue that memes are remixed, iterated messages which are rapidly spread by members of participatory digital culture for the purpose of continuing a conversation. We understand that memes develop from emergent memes, which we define as altered or remixed spreadable media. We have adapted and modified Jenkins’ term “spreadable media” to refer to original or non-parodied messages. Our analysis benefits from the inclusion of Anthony Giddens’ structuration theory to aid in understanding how memes as artifacts of participatory digital culture are created. Our genre development of memes demonstrates the generative capacity for continued memetic transformation and for participation among members of digital culture. We use structuration to position these dynamic components as the core of a duality of structure for Internet memes. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.},

  abstract = {This paper is intended as a focal article to raise philosophical issues about the nature of memes and memetic theory. To bring consistency to memetic analysis, researchers need to understand and agree upon the theoretical role of memes and the generalized model of evolution in which it occurs as a theoretical term. To help this, I have traced the source of Dawkins' conception of memes from GC Williams' evolutionary gene and through to the Hull-Dawkins Distinction between replicators and interactors and Hull's notion of lineages and the idea of an individual in biology. The complexity of biological modes of evolution suggests that conceptualizing memes as disease pathogens is not an alternative to evolutionary models of memetic development. I argue for a close and strict analogy between biology and memetics. I introduce the idea of a memetic individual or profile to clarify the ontology of memes and their ecologies. Some promising methods from biology and other disciplines such as Hamming Distance and Wagner groundplan divergence methods are suggested. A glossary of mainly biological technical terms used and introduced neologisms is included.},

  abstract = {This article examines the significance, in the lives of those who experienced out-of-home care as children, of the archived records of their institutionalisation. The affective ramifications of accessing the records as adults are discussed, with especial focus on the records’ capacity to revive past suffering. Drawing on the work of Bruner (Crit Inq Autumn 1–21,1991, Consumption and everyday life, Sage, London, 1997) and MacIntyre (After virtue: a study in moral theory, University of Notre Dame Press, Notre Dame, 1981), a ‘narrative’ model of the self is utilised to account for the negative effect of systemic flaws in the records’ original composition. Such flaws, it is argued, have the potential to disrupt the individual’s sense of self. Both the authors, who experienced out-of-home care as children, present their own experiences of accessing the records, as case studies. The records’ manifold inaccuracies and inadequacies are interpreted in the light of prevailing welfare practices, in particular a highly damaging judgemental paradigm of gendered and moralistic assumptions of the inferior character of those in care. The authors conclude by arguing that research into the archives should involve the direct participation, as ‘insider researchers’, of those who experienced the matters contained in the records. Such participation is essential if the process of revealing and interpreting the archives is to maintain the dignity of the records’ subject individuals, and ensure the integrity of the research. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

  abstract = {Sentiment information about social media posts is increasingly considered an important resource for customer segmentation, market understanding, and tackling other socio-economic issues. However, sentiment in social media is difficult to measure since user-generated content is usually short and informal. Although many traditional sentiment analysis methods have been proposed, identifying slang sentiment words remains a challenging task for practitioners. Though some slang words are available in existing sentiment lexicons, with new slang being generated with emerging memes, a dedicated lexicon will be useful for researchers and practitioners. To this end, we propose to build a slang sentiment dictionary to aid sentiment analysis. It is laborious and time-consuming to collect a comprehensive list of slang words and label the sentiment polarity. We present an approach to leverage web resources to construct a Slang Sentiment Dictionary (SlangSD) that is easy to expand. SlangSD is publicly available for research purposes. We empirically show the advantages of using SlangSD, the newly-built slang sentiment word dictionary for sentiment classification, and provide examples demonstrating its ease of use with a sentiment analysis system. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract = {Sentiment information about social media posts is increasingly considered an important resource for customer segmentation, market understanding, and tackling other socio-economic issues. However, sentiment in social media is difficult to measure since user-generated content is usually short and informal. Although many traditional sentiment analysis methods have been proposed, identifying slang sentiment words remains a challenging task for practitioners. Though some slang words are available in existing sentiment lexicons, with new slang being generated with emerging memes, a dedicated lexicon will be useful for researchers and practitioners. To this end, we propose to build a slang sentiment dictionary to aid sentiment analysis. It is laborious and time-consuming to collect a comprehensive list of slang words and label the sentiment polarity. We present an approach to leverage web resources to construct a Slang Sentiment Dictionary (SlangSD) that is easy to expand. SlangSD is publicly available for research purposes. We empirically show the advantages of using SlangSD, the newly-built slang sentiment word dictionary for sentiment classification, and provide examples demonstrating its ease of use with a sentiment analysis system. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract = {The multilevel model of meme diffusion conceptualizes how mediated messages diffuse over time and space. As a pilot application of implementing the meme diffusion, we developed the social media analytics and research testbed to monitor Twitter messages and track the diffusion of information in and across different cities and geographic regions. Social media analytics and research testbed is an online geo-targeted search and analytics tool, including an automatic data processing procedure at the backend and an interactive frontend user interface. Social media analytics and research testbed is initially designed to facilitate (1) searching and geo-locating tweet topics and terms in different cities and geographic regions; (2) filtering noise from raw data (such as removing redundant retweets and using machine learning methods to improve precision); (3) analyzing social media data from a spatiotemporal perspective; and (4) visualizing social media data in diagnostic ways (such as weekly and monthly trends, trend maps, top media, top retweets, top mentions, or top hashtags). Social media analytics and research testbed provides researchers and domain experts with a tool that can efficiently facilitate the refinement, formalization, and testing of research hypotheses or questions. Three case studies (flu outbreaks, Ebola epidemic, and marijuana legalization) are introduced to illustrate how the predictions of meme diffusion can be examined and to demonstrate the potentials and key functions of social media analytics and research testbed. © The Author(s) 2016.},

  abstract = {The multilevel model of meme diffusion conceptualizes how mediated messages diffuse over time and space. As a pilot application of implementing the meme diffusion, we developed the social media analytics and research testbed to monitor Twitter messages and track the diffusion of information in and across different cities and geographic regions. Social media analytics and research testbed is an online geo-targeted search and analytics tool, including an automatic data processing procedure at the backend and an interactive frontend user interface. Social media analytics and research testbed is initially designed to facilitate (1) searching and geo-locating tweet topics and terms in different cities and geographic regions; (2) filtering noise from raw data (such as removing redundant retweets and using machine learning methods to improve precision); (3) analyzing social media data from a spatiotemporal perspective; and (4) visualizing social media data in diagnostic ways (such as weekly and monthly trends, trend maps, top media, top retweets, top mentions, or top hashtags). Social media analytics and research testbed provides researchers and domain experts with a tool that can efficiently facilitate the refinement, formalization, and testing of research hypotheses or questions. Three case studies (flu outbreaks, Ebola epidemic, and marijuana legalization) are introduced to illustrate how the predictions of meme diffusion can be examined and to demonstrate the potentials and key functions of social media analytics and research testbed. © The Author(s) 2016.},

  abstract = {TikTok, a short video platform featuring content between 15 and 60 seconds long, has become a popular and rapidly growing social media application around the world. As a platform catering for light entertainment, TikTok champions virality and encourages memetic remixes. Meme videos, mostly featuring lip-syncs, dance routines, and skits, have become one of the defining features of the platform. These seemingly trivial videos have been utilised by young TikTokers to advocate for various causes. This paper uses \#OkBoomer memes as a case study to examine the political culture of young people and Gen Z in particular. By analysing how intergenerational politics has been ‘memefied’, this study delineates how Gen Z imagines and expresses a generational sentiment towards ‘Boomers’ as the imagined other. They do so through short video cultures and practices on TikTok, drawing upon the networked experiences of their peers. Specifically, the paper considers the key controversial issues, meme forms and meme functions across the \#OkBoomer memes on TikTok, and its eventual mainstreaming in society. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

However, in this study, we demonstrate that the sleeping beauty is an interesting and unexceptional phenomenon in information diffusion; more inspiring is that there exists two consecutive sleeping beauties in the entire lifetime of a meme’s propagation, which suggests that the information, including scientific topics, search queries or Wikipedia entries, which we call memes, will go unnoticed for a period and suddenly attract some attention, and then it falls asleep again and later wakes up with another unexpected popularity peak. Further exploration of this phenomenon shows that the intervals between two wake-ups follow an exponential distributions, both the rising and falling stage lengths, follow power law distributions, and the second wake-up tends to reach its peak in a shorter period of time. In addition, the total volumes of the two wake-ups have positive correlations. Taking these findings into consideration, an upgraded Bass model is presented to well describe the diffusion dynamics of memes on different media.

  abstract = {This paper presents the first systematic analysis of memes created by Palestinians in Israel. An analysis of 150 memes reveals how memes are used to reflect on and intervene in Palestinian youths’ navigation of life in mixed cities under prolonged war and colonialism. I analyze these memes at three different levels: global popular culture and politics, in relation to the Israeli State, and Palestinian in-group dynamics. The analysis reveals a divide between Palestinians and Israelis despite living in mixed cities, putting the myth of coexistence in such cities into question. Memes appear to function both in navigating the contested cultural and spatial politics and carving out space in the cultural landscape for youths’ aspirations. I propose a framework that conceptualizes Internet memes as mapping tools of everyday life. I argue that memes map out the social, cultural, and political landscape in which meme makers live and operate, and further reveals the intricate ties between new media technology and the political, cultural, and spatial arenas. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

  abstract = {In this work, we explore the types of triggers that spark trends on Twitter, introducing a typology with the following 4 types: news, ongoing events, memes, and commemoratives. While previous research has analyzed trending topics over the long term, we look at the earliest tweets that produce a trend, with the aim of categorizing trends early on. This allows us to provide a filtered subset of trends to end users. We experiment with a set of straightforward language-independent features based on the social spread of trends and categorize them using the typology. Our method provides an efficient way to accurately categorize trending topics without need of external data, enabling news organizations to discover breaking news in real-time, or to quickly identify viral memes that might inform marketing decisions, among others. The analysis of social features also reveals patterns associated with each type of trend, such as tweets about ongoing events being shorter as many were likely sent from mobile devices, or memes having more retweets originating from a few trend-setters. © 2014 ASIS\&T.},
